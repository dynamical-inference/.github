# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is the Github account of the [Dynamical Inference Lab](https://dynamical-inference.ai) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/computational-health-center).

We build machine learning algorithms for representation learning and inference of nonlinear system dynamics. We apply these algorithms to model complex biological systems in neuroscience, cell biology and other life science applications.

If you are interested in representation learning algorithms and/or their applications, please reach out! We are hiring for fully-funded PhD, postdoc and research engineering positions, and also welcome undergraduate and Masterâ€™s students to apply for research visits, internships and research assistant positions.
