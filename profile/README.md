# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is the Github account of the [Dynamical Inference Lab](https://dynamical-inference.ai).

We build machine learning algorithms for representation learning and inference of nonlinear system dynamics.
We apply these algorithms to model complex biological systems in neuroscience, cell biology and other life science applications.

**The lab will open in Spring 2024** at Helmholtz Munich.
We are currently hiring for fully-funded PhD, Postdoc and Research engineering positions, and also welcome undergraduate and Masterâ€™s students to apply for research visits, internships and research assistant positions! If you are interested in representation learning algorithms and/or their applications in the life sciences, please apply!
